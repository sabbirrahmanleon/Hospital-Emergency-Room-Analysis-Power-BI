# 🚨 Hospital Emergency Room Analysis — More than Just a Dashboard 🚨

Ever came across a dashboard on social media and felt confused—like it's just a random set of charts stitched together with no real story?

That disconnect usually comes from a lack of context and purpose.

With this in mind, I set out to create something different:

A Hospital Emergency Room dashboard that doesn’t just visualize data—but tells a full story.

- It starts with clear objectives

- It frames the data with context

- It leads you through insightful visualizations

- And ends with evidence-based recommendations for real-world impact

📊 Key Highlights from the Dashboard:

• 🏥 9,216 ER visits analyzed across a 19-month period

• ⏱️ Average wait time: 35 minutes – with peak congestion on Fridays and Sundays

• 💬 Patient satisfaction score averages just 4.99/10, reflecting urgent opportunities for care improvement

• 🎯 59% of patients missed service-level targets, highlighting systemic process delays

• 📍 Referral bottlenecks in Neurology & Physiotherapy, with the majority of patients not referred for continued care

🔍 This dashboard isn't just about numbers—it's a strategic tool designed to:

- Help hospital leaders enhance service delivery

- Enable clinical teams to triage more effectively

- Drive data-informed decisions that put patients first



🧠 Data means little without context, and I built this to show what’s possible when analytics are driven by purpose, not just visuals.
